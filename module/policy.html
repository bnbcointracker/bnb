We are not required to verify the accuracy, authenticity or validity of any Instruction and will not monitor or reject Instructions on the basis that they are, or appear to be, duplicates. However, if we are in doubt as to the accuracy, authenticity or validity of an Instruction, we may refuse to act upon or defer acting upon any Instruction, or seek further information with respect to the Instruction.

Your Instruction is not deemed to be received by us until it has been received by our server. Our record of all Instructions will be conclusive and binding on you for all purposes.

By submitting an Instruction you or your Permitted Users are authorising us to initiate the Transaction on your BNB Account. We are therefore authorised to credit or debit (or provide settlement information to third parties for the purposes of the third party crediting or debiting) your Digital Assets from your BNB Account in accordance with your Instruction. If you have insufficient Digital Assets or Fiat Currency in your BNB Account to effect the Transaction (i.e. less than the required amount to settle the Transaction and to pay all the fees associated with the Transaction), then we have the right to refuse to effect any Transaction. It is your responsibility to hold sufficient Digital Assets or Fiat Currency credited in your BNB Account.</p>

Subject to these Terms and any applicable Product Terms, and provided that you have sufficient balance on your BNB Account and the relevant Digital Assets are not on hold in your BNB Account in connection with any BNB Service, you may give Instructions to BNB to transfer Digital Assets to an external wallet address by submitting a withdrawal request on the Platform. Upon receipt of the withdrawal request, BNB will: 
                                    <br><br>(i) deduct your BNB Account balance; and

                                You do not earn Bonus Tiered Rewards for the first day (Monday).

                                The amount you would have received in total to your Spot Account is calculated as follows:

                                <br><br>
                                = 10001.09595044 + 1.36986301 = 10002.46581345 ABC

                                <p class="head-sharp py-2">F. Market Risks</p>
                                <p class="head-thick pb-2">An investment in Digital Assets carries significant risk. The value of an investment and any returns can go up or down, and you may lose all or part of your investment and not get back the amount you had invested. If you are new to Digital Assets, consider investing only a small amount. Only invest what you can afford to lose. It is important to do your own research to understand the risks of investing in Digital Assets. To learn more about Digital Assets, please refer to https://academy.binance.com/en.</p>
                                <p class="head-thick pb-2">Digital Asset trading is speculative, prices are volatile and market movements are difficult to predict. Supply and demand for Digital Assets can change rapidly without warning and can be affected by a variety of factors which may not be predictable, including regulation, general economic trends and developments in the Digital Asset ecosystem. All investments in Digital Assets carry the risk of loss.</p>
                                <p class="head-thick pb-2">Past performance is not an indicator of future performance.  BNB does not in any way guarantee or provide any assurance about the performance or market price of Digital Assets or products available through the BNB Services.</p>
                                <p class="head-thick pb-2">The Digital Asset industry is subject to systemic and systematic risk. Systemic and systematic risks are both threats to the Digital Asset markets and economy, but the cause of these risks and the approaches for managing them are different. Systemic risk is the risk that a company or industry-level risk could trigger a major collapse. Systematic risk is the risk inherent to the entire market, which can be economic, sociopolitical, technological, or natural in origin. These risks can affect the prices of Digital Assets.</p>
                                <p class="head-thick pb-2">Blockchain technology is a relatively new technology that is evolving rapidly and is likely to be subject to continued technological development.  The future development and growth of the Digital Asset industry is subject to a variety of factors that are difficult to predict and evaluate. Similarly, the sustainability of Digital Asset networks may also be affected by a range of different factors.  All such factors may impact the value of a Digital Asset.</p>
                                <p class="head-thick pb-2">Negative perceptions about Digital Assets may reduce the confidence of investors in the industry and result in greater volatility of the prices in Digital Assets, including possibly a significant depreciation in value.  Any events that trigger negative publicity in respect of Digital Asset markets may therefore have an adverse impact on the value of any investment in Digital Assets.    </p>

                                <p class="head-sharp py-2">G. Counterparty Risk</p>
                                <p class="head-thick pb-2">You may be exposed to counterparty risk in various circumstances when using BNB Services. This may include, without limitation, if a market maker or liquidity provider faces issues which could result in slippage or an inability to execute trades; failures by or disputes with payment processors which may delay deposit and withdrawal transactions; borrowers defaulting on their repayment obligations which may delay the redemption of deposits from certain products.</p>
                                <p class="head-thick pb-2">In such other exceptional circumstances, your holdings and your ability to transact or deal with your holdings, may be adversely affected which may result in a range of outcomes including, without limitation, transactions not completing as expected, trading costs being irrecoverable, loss of profits, inability to acquire or dispose of assets at the desired time or price.</p>

                                <p class="head-sharp py-2">H. Liquidity risk</p>
                                <p class="head-thick pb-2">Digital Asset prices on the secondary market are driven by supply and demand and may be highly volatile. Digital Assets may have limited liquidity which may make it difficult or impossible for you to sell or exit a position when you wish to do so. This may occur at any time, including at times of rapid price movements.</p>

                                <p class="head-sharp py-2">I. Fees & Charges</p>
                                <p class="head-thick pb-2">Our fees and charges are set out here. BNB may, in its discretion, update the fees & charges from time to time. Please be aware of all fees and charges that apply to you, because such fees and charges will affect the returns you generate from using BNB Services.</p>

                                <p class="head-sharp py-2">J. Availability Risk</p>
                                <p class="head-thick pb-2">While we aim to deliver a seamless user experience, we cannot guarantee that the BNB Services will be available at any particular time or that BNB Services will not be subject to unplanned service outages or network congestion. It may not be possible for you to buy, sell, transfer, send or receive Digital Assets when you wish to do so.</p>
                                <p class="head-thick pb-2">There are legal requirements in various countries which may restrict the products and services that BNB can lawfully provide. Accordingly, some products and services and/or certain functionality within the Platform, including but not limited to fiat services, may not be available or may be restricted in certain jurisdictions or regions or to certain Users and any BNB campaigns, user competitions or other promotions will not be open to (and are not targeted at or intended for) Users to whom restrictions apply.  Users are responsible for informing themselves about, and observing any restrictions and/or requirements imposed with respect to, the access to and use of the Platform and the BNB Services in each jurisdiction from which the Platform and the BNB Services are accessed by or on behalf of the User.  BNB reserves the right to modify such restrictions or impose additional restrictions with respect to the access to and use of the Platform and/or the BNB Services from time to time in its sole discretion without notification.  </p>

                                <p class="head-sharp py-2">K. Third Party Risk</p>
                                <p class="head-thick pb-2">Third parties, such as payment providers, custodians, and banking partners may be involved in the provision of BNB Services. You may be subject to the terms & conditions of these third parties.,Unless expressly provided otherwise, BNB will not be responsible for any loss that may be incurred by you as a result of or arising from the services provided by such third parties. </p>

                                <p class="head-sharp py-2">L. Security Risk</p>
                                <p class="head-thick pb-2">The nature of Digital Assets exposes them to an increased risk of cyberattack. While BNB uses all reasonable efforts to safeguard Digital Assets and protect the Platform from cyberattack, it is not possible for any exchange to eliminate security risks entirely. There can be no guarantee that systems in place to mitigate cybersecurity threats will always be effective to prevent improper access to the Platform and Digital Assets.   </p>
                                <p class="head-thick pb-2">You are responsible for keeping your BNB Account information safe, and you shall be responsible for all the Transactions under your BNB Account, whether you authorised them or not. Transactions in Digital Assets may be irreversible, and losses due to fraudulent or unauthorised transactions may not be recoverable.</p>

                                <p class="head-sharp py-2">M. Risks related to Digital Assets</p>
                                <p class="head-thick pb-2">Given the nature of Digital Assets and their underlying technologies, there are a number of intrinsic risks, including but not limited to:</p>
                                <p class="head-thick pb-2">a. faults, defects, hacks, exploits, errors, protocol failures or unforeseen circumstances occurring in respect of a Digital Asset or the technologies or economic systems on which the Digital Asset rely;</p>
                                <p class="head-thick pb-2">b. transactions in Digital Assets being irreversible. Consequently, losses due to fraudulent or accidental transactions may not be recoverable;</p>
                                <p class="head-thick pb-2">c. technological developments leading to the obsolescence of a Digital Asset;</p>
                                <p class="head-thick pb-2">d. network delays causing transactions to not be settled on the scheduled delivery date; </p>
                                <p class="head-thick pb-2">e. attacks on the protocol or technologies on which a Digital Asset depends;</p>
                                <p class="head-thick pb-2">f. a hard fork may occur if Digital Asset developers suggest changes to a particular Digital Asset software and the updated software is not compatible with the original software and a sufficient number (but not necessarily a majority) of users and minors elect not to migrate to the updated software. This would result in two versions of Digital Asset networks running in parallel and a split of the blockchain underlying the Digital Asset network, which could impact the demand of the Digital Asset and adversely impact the price of the Digital Asset;</p>
                                <p class="head-thick pb-2">g. certain addresses on the blockchain networks hold a significant amount of the currently outstanding asset on that network. If one of these addresses were to exit their positions, this may result in volatility that could adversely affect the price of that asset;</p>
                                <p class="head-thick pb-2">h. if anyone gains control of over 51% of the computing power (hash rate) used by a blockchain network, they could use their majority share to double spend their Digital Assets. Whilst the risk of this occurring for networks with wider adoption is remote, if such a “51% attack” were to be successful, this would significantly erode trust in public blockchain networks (like Bitcoin and Ethereum) to store value and serve as a means of exchange, which may significantly decrease the value of Digital Assets;</p>
                                <p class="head-thick pb-2">i. Digital Assets are subject to the risk of fraud or cyber attacks; </p>
                                <p class="head-thick pb-2">j. Digital Assets purchased and held in an account with BNB are not covered by any external investor compensation, customer asset protection, deposit protection, insurance or other similar schemes; and</p>
                                <p class="head-thick pb-2">k. new risks may arise from investing in new types of Digital Assets or market participants’ engagement in more complex transaction strategies. Digital Assets and the Digital Asset market is subject to speculative interest, rapid price swings and uncertainty.</p>

                                <p class="head-sharp py-2">N. Monitoring Risks </p>
                                <p class="head-thick pb-2">Digital Asset markets are open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Rapid price changes may occur at any time, including outside of normal business hours</p>

                                <p class="head-sharp py-2">O. Communication Risks</p>
                                <p class="head-thick pb-2">When you communicate with us via electronic communication, you should be aware that electronic communications can fail, can be delayed, may not be secure and/or may not reach the intended destination</p>

                                <p class="head-sharp py-2">P. Currency</p>
                                <p class="head-thick pb-2">Currency exchange fluctuations may impact your gains and losses</p>

                                <p class="head-sharp py-2">Q. Legal and Regulatory Risks</p>
                                <p class="head-thick pb-2">Most Digital Assets operate without a central authority and are generally not backed by any government or authority. Changes in laws and regulations may materially affect the value of Digital Assets. This risk is unpredictable and may vary from market to market</p>
                                <p class="head-thick pb-2">Further, Digital Assets may not be considered “property” under Applicable Laws in some jurisdictions. This may affect the nature and enforceability of your interest in the Digital Assets</p>
                                <p class="head-thick pb-2">Legislative and regulatory changes may adversely affect or restrict (as applicable) the use, transfer, exchange and value of Digital Assets, as well as the provision of the BNB Services in certain jurisdictions. Legislative and regulatory changes may occur quickly and without prior notice</p>

                                <p class="head-sharp py-2">R. Simple Earn Risk</p>
                                <p class="head-thick pb-2">To the extent that Simple Earn Assets deposited by users are loaned to BNB Affiliates or clients of BNB Group Entities, including under Margin and Loan products, these loaned assets are subject to the risk that the borrowing party will be unable or unwilling to repay the borrowed assets. BNB takes various precautions to minimise this counterparty risk of borrowers defaulting, including (a) conducting due diligence on prospective borrowers under Margin and Loan products and (b) requiring borrowers under Margin and Loan products to provide collateral as security for the repayment obligation. In addition, a vast majority of the Loans and Margin loans that are funded by Simple Earn Assets are overcollateralised, meaning that the borrowing client is required to provide collateral having a value that is greater than the amount of the loan.  Further, BNB and BNB Affiliates maintain an insurance fund that is available to cover losses that would otherwise be incurred by BNB when a user’s Margin balance is insufficient to cover the user’s debt obligation to BNB. Details of the insurance fund are available here: https://www.binance.com/en/margin/insurance-fund. </p>
                                <p class="head-thick pb-2">BNB’s ability to return your Simple Earn Assets may be adversely affected or delayed if a significant number of borrowers (including under Margin and Loan products) default on the obligation to repay borrowed assets to BNB, the collateral held by or for the benefit of BNB is insufficient to cover the outstanding loan amount and outstanding debts cannot be recovered from the insurance fund.</p>
                                <p class="head-thick pb-2">In extreme and exceptional circumstances, BNB may have insufficient liquid assets readily available to satisfy requests to redeem Simple Earn Assets in a timely manner as a result of various different other factors including, without limitation, concentrated exposure to the performance of a particular Digital Asset, a particular borrowing client or a particular depositor.  BNB has processes in place to monitor and minimise liquidity risk and concentration risk. This includes, for example, limiting the maximum amount that an individual borrower is able to borrow and limiting the maximum amount that a user can subscribe to Simple Earn Offers. These controls limit BNB’s exposure to the risk of default of any particular borrower and also limit BNB’s dependency on the deposits of any particular user for liquidity. In addition, for each Digital Asset, there is a maximum percentage of Simple Earn Assets that can be made available for lending, which is determined based on the volatility, liquidity and market capitalisation of the relevant Digital Asset.</p>
                                <p class="head-thick pb-2">Digital Assets that are deployed in on-chain staking will be subject to a number of risks, including the risk of protocol penalties (known as “slashing”) which result in the forfeiture of some or all of the Digital Assets that are staked. Slashing is designed to discourage network validators from engaging in dishonest, malicious or other inappropriate activity and may occur due to errors in smart contracts, misbehaviour of validators, or mistakes during block production. Slashing is very rare. For example, only 0.04% of the over 500,000 Ethereum validators ever experienced a slashing event, according to data from February 2023. While BNB takes all reasonable precautions to avoid slashing and will wish to compensate users as far as possible (acting at its own discretion) to replace Digital Assets lost to slashing penalties if they do occur, so that you should not experience any loss even in the event of slashing, in some rare situations it is possible you could lose some or all of your Staked Assets. This would include situations where slashing is the result of a hack, your own actions or other extreme events.</p>
                                <p class="head-thick pb-2">BNB may run promotional campaigns from time to time that are sponsored by partner projects including short-term Simple Earn product offerings with higher APRs to benefit users. These higher rates may be temporary and you should consider whether the relevant offer still meets your needs once the interest rate reverts to its normal level when the promotion period expires.</p>
                                <p class="head-thick pb-2">Although BNB takes all reasonable precautions to minimise the risks described in this Risk Warning and to safeguard the return of Simple Earn Assets to users in accordance with the Simple Earn Terms, in extreme and exceptional circumstances BNB may not have sufficient assets readily available to return Simple Earn Assets to users in a timely manner. This could result in users losing some or all of their Simple Earn Assets or experiencing a delay in the return of all or some Simple Earn Assets to users. These exceptional circumstances could arise, for example, following a catastrophic hack or technical failure, a significant number of borrowers to whom loans have been granted under Margin and Loan products defaulting at the same time, depletion of the insurance fund, extreme market volatility, network delays or disruptions, systemic risk or other black swan events that affect the cryptocurrency market as a whole.</p>

                                <p class="head-sharp py-2">S. ETH Staking Risks</p>
                                <p class="head-thick pb-2">Staking involves a risk of protocol penalties, also known as “slashing”, designed to disincentive dishonest and malicious validator activity, where some or all of a validator’s staked Digital  Assets are forfeited as a penalty. Slashing can occur due to errors in smart contracts, misbehaviour of validators, or mistakes during block production. Slashing is very rare, with only 0.04% of the over 500,000 Ethereum validators ever experiencing a slashing event, according to data from February 2023. While BNB takes all reasonable precautions to avoid slashing and will wish to compensate users as far as possible (acting at our discretion) to replace Digital Assets lost to slashing penalties if they do occur, so that you should not experience any loss even in the event of slashing, in some rare situations it is possible you could lose some or all of your Staked Assets. This would include situations where slashing is the result of a hack, your own actions or other extreme events.</p>
                                <p class="head-thick pb-2">Staking Rewards are calculated based on the Variable Reward Rate and each user’s amount of Staked Assets.  The Variable Reward Rate is determined by BNB in its discretion, based on the On-Chain Rewards and the commission fee charged by BNB, each of which may change from time to time. All On-Chain Rewards will be retained by BNB and participants in ETH Staking will only receive the Staking Rewards, which may be more or less than the amount of On-Chain Rewards.</p>
                                <p class="head-thick pb-2">Users may not be able to redeem the entirety of their Staked Assets in a single redemption request and may be required to submit multiple redemption requests over a period of time.  Due to the processing limitations on the Ethereum network, redemptions are subject to the Redemption Pool and each user’s Daily Redemption Quota.  The Redemption Pool is the total amount of ETH that BNB has unstaked and is available each day to satisfy requests for the redemption of Staked Assets. The Daily Redemption Quota is the maximum amount of Staked Assets that each user can request for redemption each day.  Both the Redemption Pool, the Daily Redemption Quota and anticipated the processing may change from time to time. You can also check the delivery date and status for submitted redemption requests here. WBETH and BETH under the redemption process will not generate any ETH Staking rewards.</p>
                                <p class="head-thick pb-2">BNB does not guarantee that you will receive Staking Rewards at the Variable Staking Rate shown at the time you Subscribe. The Variable Staking Rate will change from time to time and may fluctuate up or down from the rate applicable at the time of Subscription. Any representation concerning possible returns at the time you Subscribe is an estimate only and not guaranteed; and based on the Variable Staking Rate at the relevant time, which may change.</p>
                                <p class="head-thick pb-2">Redeeming Staked Assets takes time. Redeeming BETH or WBETH for ETH is generally expected to take approximately six (6) days once a redemption request is successfully submitted, however the actual processing time may vary and could be significantly longer.  Delivery of ETH following a redemption request or WBETH following a conversion request could be subject to additional delay in various circumstances including, without limitation,  extreme market volatility, network delays and outages, validator or protocol failure, a significant number of simultaneous instructions to convert ETH to WBETH or WBETH to ETH from other BNB users, or other unanticipated events. There is no guaranteed timeframe for completion of redemption or conversion requests.  Because cryptocurrency prices can be highly volatile, there is a risk that the market price of ETH could be significantly higher or lower by the time the redemption request is completed and users will be unable to dispose of their Staked Assets while a redemption request is being processed. In addition, in rare or extreme situations it is possible that the value of your Staked Assets or Staking Rewards may drop to zero.</p>
                                <p class="head-thick pb-2">BNB does not guarantee uninterrupted or error-free operation of the ETH Staking Services or that it will correct all defects or prevent disruptions or unauthorized access. BNB may suspend or discontinue the ETH Staking Services in its sole discretion at any time. If there is any disruption, suspension or discontinuance of the ETH Staking Services, any Staked Assets may stop generating Staking Rewards and you may not receive any (and you may forfeit all or some) Staking Rewards. BNB has no liability or responsibility for and expressly disclaims any loss, liability or damage that users may incur directly or indirectly in connection with the ETH Staking Services, including without limitation loss, liability or damage arising directly or indirectly from interruptions, errors or defects in the ETH Staking Services, third party disruptions of or unauthorized access to the ETH Staking Services and any suspension or discontinuance of the ETH Staking Services.</p>

                                <p class="head-sharp py-2">T. Risk of trading using leverage</p>
                                <p class="head-thick pb-2">Trading using leverage entails significant risk and it is important that you fully understand the risks involved in trading Digital Assets using leverage.</p>
                                <p class="head-thick pb-2">A relatively small market movement will have a proportionately larger impact on the leveraged funds you have deposited or will have to deposit; this may work against you as well as for you. You may sustain a total loss of initial margin funds and, in exceptional circumstances, any additional funds deposited with BNB to maintain your position. If the market moves against your position or margin levels are increased, you may be called upon to pay substantial additional funds on short notice to maintain your position. If you fail to comply with a request for additional funds within the time prescribed, your position may be liquidated at a loss and you may, in exceptional circumstances, be liable for any resulting deficit.</p>


                                <p class="head-sharp py-2">U. Risk of trading Futures</p>
                                <p class="head-thick pb-2">Futures are complex leveraged products and may not be suitable for inexperienced investors. Before investing, investors must understand the nature and accept the risks of futures products, including extreme price volatility of Digital Asset Futures and the risk that the value of a Digital Asset Futures position may decline rapidly and significantly, including to zero. While Digital Asset Futures amplifies the potential profit of trading in Digital Assets, it also amplifies the risk of loss.  All the risks relating to the underlying Digital Assets may be magnified in Digital Asset Futures because of the use of leverage.</p>
                                <p class="head-thick pb-2">The risk of loss is substantial. In volatile market conditions, the price of Digital Assets, and therefore the price of Digital Asset Futures, may decline significantly in a short period of time, including to zero. An investor in Digital Asset Futures must be prepared and able to bear the loss of the entirety of  their investment.</p>
                                <p class="head-thick pb-2">You should not invest any amount  that you cannot afford to lose. You are strongly encouraged to seek independent professional advice when deciding whether Digital Asset Futures products are suitable for you, having regard to your risk appetite, financial position and knowledge about Digital Assets. </p>
                                <p class="head-thick pb-2">When trading Futures, it is your responsibility:</p>
                                <p class="head-thick pb-2">a. To familiarise yourself with Digital Assets and Futures before you start trading.</p>
                                <p class="head-thick pb-2">b. To monitor your open positions and, when required,  to reduce your position or deposit additional margin to avoid liquidation.</p>
                                <p class="head-thick pb-2">c. Manage your exposure and not risk more than you can afford to lose.</p>
                                <p class="head-thick pb-2">When trading Futures you may suffer a loss as a result of a number of factors including but not limited to the following: (i) a position in Futures moving against you, for example, you hold a long position and the price of the underlying Digital Asset declines or you hold a short position and the price of the underlying Digital Asset increases. You may lose the entirety of your investment, including all assets that you have made available as margin for the position; (ii) your profitable position may be force closed under auto-deleveraging, because one or more of the  counter-parties to your profitable position has provide insufficient collateral, resulting in you not receiving some or all of the profits that you may otherwise be entitled to receive; (iii) you cannot close a Futures position because there is insufficient market liquidity or demand for the other side of that trade; (iv) we are required to change parameters on the Platform such as the margin requirements; (v) there is a malfunction of the Platform, for example resulting from scheduled or unscheduled downtimes, matching system failure, database failure, cryptocurrency transfer or storage failure, failure or malfunction of the API, hacker attacks or other failure or malfunction.</p>
                                <p class="head-thick pb-2">The market price of a Futures contract for a Digital Asset may not mirror the price of the relevant Digital Asset in the spot market. The price of a Futures contract for a Digital Asset may also fluctuate significantly in response to movements in the price of the underlying Digital Asset, supply and demand, and other market factors.</p>
                                <p class="head-thick pb-2">In order to open and maintain a Futures position, you will be required to provide collateral as margin. The use of leverage allows traders to provide a relatively small amount of margin for a position with significantly more market exposure.  However, this use of leverage means that a relatively small change in the market price of the underlying Digital Asset could result in liquidation of a position and loss of assets.  For example, a 1% decrease in the price of a Digital Asset underlying a 10x leveraged long Futures contract  is equal to a  10% loss in the long Futures position.   Conversely, a 1% increase in the price of a Digital Asset underlying a 10x leveraged short Futures contract is equal to a 10% loss in the short Futures position.</p>
                                <p class="head-thick pb-2">If the market moves against your Futures position, you may be required to provide additional margin on short notice in order to maintain your Futures positions, failing which your position may be liquidated.  If you are subject to liquidation, you may  sustain a total loss of all collateral that has been provided or otherwise made available to establish or maintain a position, including collateral provided to meet margin calls. Further, you may, in exceptional circumstances, be responsible and liable for any deficit resulting in your Account following liquidation of your positions. It is your responsibility to ensure that you have sufficient margin in your Account to maintain all open positions.</p>
                                <p class="head-thick pb-2">Perpetual Futures Products do not have a fixed term. You will be subject to funding rates for the duration of your positions in Perpetual Futures Products. </p>
                                <p class="head-thick pb-2">BNB may at its sole discretion determine to terminate the offering of Futures. If you are required to close your Futures positions, or your Futures positions are forced closed, at a time when the market price of the underlying Digital Asset is not favourable, you may suffer losses as a result. BNB will not be responsible for any losses resulting from such termination.</p>
                                <p class="head-thick pb-2">The placing of certain “stop-loss” orders, or “stop-limit” orders which are intended to limit losses to certain amounts may not always be effective because rapidly changing market conditions may make it impossible to execute such orders. Strategies using combinations of positions such as “spread” and “straddle” positions may be as risky as taking simply “long” or “short” positions.</p>
 
                                <p class="head-sharp py-2">V. Risk of trading Options</p>
                                <p class="head-thick pb-2">Transactions in options carry a high degree of risk. You should familiarise yourself with the type of option (i.e. put or call) which you intend on trading and the associated risks. You should calculate the extent to which the value of the options must increase for your position to become profitable, taking into account the premium and all transaction costs.</p>
                                <p class="head-thick pb-2">“Writing” or “granting” an option involves considerably greater risk than purchasing options. The premium received is fixed, however you may sustain a loss well in excess of that premium amount. You may be liable for additional margin to maintain the position if the market moves unfavourably. You may also be exposed to the risk of the purchaser exercising the option and you may be obligated to settle the option. If the option is “covered” by holding a corresponding position in the underlying interest, the risk may be reduced. If the option is not covered, the risk of loss can be unlimited.</p>

                                <p class="head-sharp py-2">W. Risk of VA Loan Services</p>
                                <p class="head-thick pb-2">BNB may require you to provide Collateral to support your obligations under certain VA Loan Services transactions. In particular, you could be asked to provide additional Collateral if the market moves unfavourably during the term of a particular VA Loan Services transaction or if BNB changes the Collateral Requirements at our discretion at any time. Such additional Collateral may be substantial in poor market conditions and in other circumstances. </p>
                                <p class="head-thick pb-2">BNB will use your Collateral in respect of Flexible Rate Loans to Subscribe to Flexible Simple Earn Offers on your behalf and such Collateral will be treated in accordance with these VA Loan Service Terms and the Simple Earn Terms. Please refer to the Risk Disclosure Statement available here for a summary overview of some (but not all) of the risks that may result from subscribing Virtual Assets to a Simple Earn Offer, including risks that may arise from the use of your Simple Earn Assets by BNB Group Entities for operating purposes. Collateral in respect of Stable Rate Loans will be transferred to the Collateral Account. All Collateral shall be held subject to BNB’s general rights in respect of your Virtual Assets as set out in the Terms of Use and as afforded by applicable law.</p>
                                <p class="head-thick pb-2">The risk of loss in financing a transaction by providing Collateral is significant. You may sustain losses in excess of the Collateral held with us. You may also sustain a total loss of the initial and any additional Collateral that you held with us. </p>
                                <p class="head-thick pb-2">You should note that small price movements in the underlying market will have a multiplying effect on your corresponding gain or loss. Losses may even exceed the amount of Collateral deposited by you and you will be liable to us for any shortfall between the Collateral and the loss incurred and you may be called upon at short notice to provide additional Virtual Assets. </p>
                                <p class="head-thick pb-2">Any failure to make up the shortfall within the time required by us may result in us liquidating your Collateral and/or terminating your Loan or VA Loan Services without your consent, applying the proceeds of such liquidation to the shortfall and claiming the balance (if any) from you. This could result in substantial costs and losses, which you will need to bear. Other consequences may also flow under these VA Loan Service Terms. You should therefore carefully consider whether the Loan or VA Loan Services is/are suitable in light of your own financial position and investment objectives. You must familiarise yourself with all the terms and conditions applicable to Collateral and any Loan and seek independent advice if needed.</p>

                                <p class="head-sharp py-2">X. Risk of Gift Card Services</p>
                                <p class="head-thick pb-2">A non-BNB entity or individual asking for BNB Gift Cards as a payment method for goods or services may be a scam.</p>
                                <p class="head-thick pb-2">We are not responsible in any way for any BNB Gift Cards that are lost, stolen, or destroyed, or if your BNB Gift Cards are used without your permission.</p>

                                <p class="head-sharp py-2">Y. RISK DISCLOSURES FOR DUAL INVESTMENT </p>
                                <p class="head-thick pb-2">Dual Investment is not a principal-protected product. It is different from other Earn products available on the Platform.</p>
                                <p class="head-thick pb-2">Dual Investment is a structured product with a number of variables to consider when Subscribing. Once your Subscription is executed, your Target Price, Settlement Date, Subscription Period and APR will be fixed. You will not be able to edit, cancel or revise the Target Price, Settlement Date, Subscription Period or APR once your Subscription is executed. There can be no guarantee or assurance that if the Target Price is reached and your Subscribed DI Assets are exchanged into the Alternative Currency, that you will be in a more favourable financial position. If the market price as at the Settlement Date of your Subscribed DI Assets is less favourable for you than the Target Price (i.e. higher than the Target Price in the case of a Sell High Dual Investment or less than the Target Price in the case of a Buy Low Dual Investment), you will still be obligated to exchange your Subscribed DI Assets and DI Rewards in the Deposit Currency for the Alternative Currency at the Target Price. Please read through the FAQ and the Product Terms carefully to ensure that you understand the product. If you do not understand the product and associated risks, you should not Subscribe or otherwise use the product.</p>
                                <p class="head-thick pb-2">The higher APR set out for Dual Investment is provided in exchange for the comparatively high risk attributable to this product. The digital asset markets can be extremely volatile. You should note that past performance is not to be treated as an indication of future performance. BNB is not liable for any losses incurred from price fluctuations. </p>
                                <p class="head-thick pb-2">We make no guarantees of rewards. You have no right to a reward even if it is received by BNB. DI Rewards will be credited to your BNB Account only after they are received by BNB. Unless otherwise specified, the APR indicated for Future Transactions is only an estimate, and may change over time. The availability of DI Rewards is subject to market volatility, and BNB does not guarantee that you will receive any DI Rewards from your Dual Investment. </p>
                                <p class="head-thick pb-2">A Subscription to Dual Investment is illiquid. Your Subscribed DI Assets will be locked and you will not be able to access or otherwise deal with your Subscribed DI Assets (together with all DI Rewards) until the Settlement Date. During the Subscription Period you will be exposed to the risk of extreme market volatility and will have no ability to exit your position in the Subscribed DI Assets prior to the Settlement Date. The illiquidity of your Subscribed DI Assets could result in losses arising from, amongst others, the inability to dispose of Digital Assets at a higher price if market prices are depreciating or loss of opportunity to buy Digital Assets at a more favourable price. </p>

                                <p class="head-sharp py-2">Z. SOL Staking Risks</p>
                                <p class="head-thick pb-2">Staking Rewards are reflected by the BNSOL Conversion Rate and each user’s amount of Staked Assets. The BNSOL Conversion Rate is based on the prevailing and applicable Solana validator-node APR and the Staking Fee charged by BNB, each of which may change from time to time. All On-Chain Rewards will be retained by BNB and participants in SOL Staking will only receive the Staking Rewards, which will be less than the On-Chain Rewards due to the Staking Fee.</p>
                                <p class="head-thick pb-2">Users may not be able to redeem the entirety of their Staked Assets in a single redemption request and may be required to submit multiple redemption requests over a period of time. Due to potential processing limitations on the Solana network caused by network failure or congestion, redemptions may be subject to limitations set by BNB. You can check the delivery date and status for submitted redemption requests here. BNSOL in respect of which a redemption request is being processed will not reflect, accrue or otherwise be entitled to receive any further Staking Rewards. </p>
                                <p class="head-thick pb-2">Redeeming Staked Assets takes time. Redeeming BNSOL for SOL is generally expected to take approximately four (4) days once a redemption request is successfully submitted, however the actual processing time may vary and could be significantly longer.  Delivery of SOL following a redemption request or BNSOL following a conversion request could be subject to additional delay in various circumstances including, without limitation, extreme market volatility, network delays and outages, validator or protocol failure, a significant number of simultaneous instructions to convert SOL to BNSOL or BNSOL to SOL from other BNB users, or other unanticipated events. There is no guaranteed timeframe for completion of redemption or conversion requests. Because cryptocurrency prices can be highly volatile, there is a risk that the market price of SOL could be significantly higher or lower by the time the redemption request is completed and users will be unable to dispose of their Staked Assets while a redemption request is being processed. In addition, in rare or extreme situations it is possible that the value of your Staked Assets or Staking Rewards may drop to zero.</p>
                                <p class="head-thick pb-2">BNB does not guarantee uninterrupted or error-free operation of the SOL Staking Services or that it will correct all defects or prevent disruptions or unauthorized access. The Solana Network may be subject to unplanned disruptions or outages. BNB may suspend or discontinue the SOL Staking Services in its sole discretion at any time. If there is any disruption, suspension or discontinuance of the SOL Staking Services, any Staked Assets may stop generating Staking Rewards and you may not receive any (and you may forfeit all or some) Staking Rewards. BNB has no liability or responsibility for and expressly disclaims any loss, liability or damage that users may incur directly or indirectly in connection with the SOL Staking Services, including without limitation loss, liability or damage arising directly or indirectly from interruptions, errors or defects in the SOL Staking Services, third party disruptions of or unauthorized access to the SOL Staking Services and any suspension or discontinuance of the SOL Staking Services. BNB may run promotional campaigns from time to time that are sponsored by partner projects including short-term SOL staking product offerings with higher APRs to benefit users. These higher rates may be temporary and you should consider whether the relevant offer still meets your needs once the interest rate reverts to its normal level when the promotion period expires.</p>

                                <p class="head-thick pb-2">This disclosure outlines the risks associated with the potential depegging of stablecoins, including (without limitation) USD Coin (USDC) and Tether (USDT), from their intended 1:1 parity with a commodity or denomination of fiat currency. </p>
                                
                                <p class="head-thick pb-2">(1) Stablecoins are designed to maintain a stable value relative to the a commodity or denomination of fiat currency.  For example, USDC and USDT are designed to maintain a stable value relative to the US Dollar (USD). However, market conditions, regulatory changes, or operational failures may cause these stablecoins to deviate from their intended 1:1 parity. Such deviations, commonly referred to as "depegging," could result in significant price fluctuations or loss of value. </p>
                                <p class="head-thick pb-2">(2) Depegging events may lead to reduced liquidity for  the stablecoin, impacting the ability to execute trades or exit positions at favorable rates. </p>
                                <p class="head-thick pb-2">(3) Unexpected market movements during depegging may lead to substantial price fluctuations, potentially increasing margin requirements or triggering liquidations.  Where USD stablecoin are used as collateral, depegging could reduce the value of collateral and increase the risk of margin calls or forced liquidations. Depegging may also result in the stablecoin asset no longer being accepted as eligible collateral.</p>
                                <p class="head-thick pb-2">(4) The value of stablecoin typically depends on the creditworthiness and operational resilience of its issuer. Any doubts regarding the issuers' ability to back the stablecoins with sufficient reserves may amplify depegging risks. </p>
                                <p class="head-thick pb-2">(5) As stablecoins are centrally issued, they are subject to counterparty risks, including potential regulatory actions or operational failures by the issuers.  Legal or regulatory measures against stablecoin issuers or related parties may impact the stability or usability of their stablecoin. Cyberattacks, technical malfunctions, or other operational issues affecting the issuers could also trigger, or increase the risk of, depegging. </p>
                                <p class="head-thick pb-2">(6) You are encouraged to monitor market conditions, issuer announcements, and regulatory developments that could affect the stability of any stablecoin you may use. </p>
                                <p class="head-thick pb-2">(7) A depegging event in one particular stablecoin may have a contagion effect, negatively impacting market sentiment towards other issues of stablecoin or the trading venues that have used or otherwise facilitated trading activity involving that stablecoin (particularly where that stablecoin may have been used as collateral or for settlement of transactions). </p>
                                <p class="head-thick pb-2">(8) You should consider diversifying your collateral and funding sources to mitigate the potential impact of depegging risks. </p>
                                <p class="head-thick pb-2">(9) There is no guarantee that any stablecoin (including, without limitation, USDC or USDT) will maintain their 1:1 parity with the reference asset/currency under all circumstances. Users should conduct independent assessments and understand the risks associated with holding or using these stablecoins.</p>

                                <p class="head-sharp py-2">AC. On Chain Yields</p>
                                <p class="head-thick pb-2">The use of Subscribed Assets for On-chain Yields Services may be subject to various risks, including protocol risks. Events may occur at the protocol level (such as hacks, exploits, or poor economic models) that are outside of BNB's control. In exceptional circumstances, these risks could negatively impact the ability of BNB to return your Subscribed Assets in full or at all. The Digital Assets you use to Subscribe may be lost because they are put into smart contracts owned by Applicable Networks and not operated by BNB. Subscribed Assets are outside of BNB's control, and neither BNB nor any BNB Affiliate can guarantee the return of Subscribed Assets. BNB does not guarantee that you will receive On-chain Yields DeFi Rewards at the DeFi Rate shown at the time you Subscribe. Any representation concerning possible returns at the time you Subscribe is an estimate only and not guaranteed.</p>
                                
                                <p class="head-thick pb-2">No BNB Group Entity makes any representation or warranty that On-chain Yields is appropriate for any user or in any location. BNB does not provide any due diligence assurances on the protocols themselves. You are strongly encouraged to carefully review these On-chain Yields Terms and seek independent professional advice as to whether On-chain Yields Services are appropriate for you, considering your personal circumstances and objectives, financial position, and risk tolerance. Always do your own research. </p>

                                <p class="head-sharp py-2">AD. Soft Staking</p>
                                <p class="head-thick pb-2">By subscribing your Spot Account to Soft Staking, you acknowledge that your Soft Staked Assets are no longer held in your Spot Account, despite their appearance there or any associated Spot Account user interface. Instead, they are transferred to the Soft Staking account, which is part of the BNB Earn program and is distinctly separate from your Spot Account. You agree that these subscribed Digital Assets are provided to BNB and may be utilised by BNB for on-chain staking and liquidity management purposes, as outlined in the Soft Staking Terms and this Risk Warning. This type of subscription introduces an entirely different risk profile for your Digital Assets compared to if you had not engaged in Soft Staking Services because BNB is using your Digital Assets to generate a return, which involves certain risks. Please ensure that you have thoroughly read and understood the risks detailed in this Risk Warning before proceeding with any Soft Staking Services.</p>

                                <p class="head-thick pb-2">Redeeming Soft Staked Assets requires time due to the nature of on-chain staking and associated processing delays for withdrawals from protocols. The withdrawal period may also vary between different staking protocols. BNB's ability to return your Soft Staked Assets in a timely manner may be adversely affected or delayed if a substantial number of Soft Staking Assets are withdrawn by users simultaneously, and the quantity of assets locked on-chain exceeds the available liquidity managed by BNB. BNB has implemented processes to monitor and mitigate liquidity risk and concentration risk. These processes include managing the maximum percentage of users’ Soft Staked Assets that are locked on-chain and limiting the Digital Assets that users can subscribe to Soft Staking Offers, based on the volatility, liquidity, and market capitalization of the relevant Digital Asset. These controls are designed to limit both BNB's and its users’ exposure to, specifically, 'duration risk' following a significant number of redemptions when Soft Staking Assets are locked on-chain.</p>
                                <p class="head-thick pb-2">Digital Assets that are deployed in on-chain staking will be subject to a number of risks, including the risk of protocol penalties (known as “slashing”) which result in the forfeiture of some or all of the Digital Assets that are staked. Slashing is designed to discourage network validators from engaging in dishonest, malicious or other inappropriate activity and may occur due to errors in smart contracts, misbehaviour of validators, or mistakes during block production. Slashing is very rare. For example, only 0.04% of the over 500,000 Ethereum validators ever experienced a slashing event, according to data from February 2023. While BNB takes all reasonable precautions to avoid slashing and will wish to compensate users as far as possible (acting at its own discretion) to replace Digital Assets lost to slashing penalties if they do occur, so that you should not experience any loss even in the event of slashing, in some rare situations it is possible you could lose some or all of your Soft Staked Assets. This would include situations where slashing is the result of a hack, your own actions or other extreme events.</p>
                                <p class="head-thick pb-2">Although BNB takes all reasonable precautions to minimise the risks described in this Risk Warning and to safeguard the return of Soft Staking Assets to users in accordance with the Soft Staking Terms, in extreme and exceptional circumstances BNB may not have sufficient assets readily available to return Soft Staking Assets to users in a timely manner. This could result in users losing some or all of their Soft Staking Asset and users losing the ability to partake in Spot Account activity (including trades) when experiencing a delay in the return of all or some Soft Staking Assets to users. These exceptional circumstances could arise, for example, following a catastrophic hack or technical failure, depletion of the available liquidity managed by BNB, extreme market volatility, network delays or disruptions, systemic risk or other black swan events that affect the cryptocurrency market as a whole.</p>
                                <p class="head-thick pb-2">There is no guaranteed timeframe for completion of redemption or conversion requests.  Because cryptocurrency prices can be highly volatile, there is a risk that the market price of your Soft Staked Assets could be significantly higher or lower by the time the redemption request is completed and users will be unable to dispose of their Soft Staked Assets while a redemption request is being processed. In addition, in rare or extreme situations it is possible that the value of your Staked Assets or Staking Rewards may drop to zero.</p>
                                <p class="head-thick pb-2">BNB does not guarantee uninterrupted or error-free operation of the Soft Staking Services or that it will correct all defects or prevent disruptions or unauthorized access. BNB may suspend or discontinue the Soft Staking Services in its sole discretion at any time. If there is any disruption, suspension or discontinuance of the Soft Staking Services, any Soft Staked Assets may stop generating Staking Rewards and you may not receive any (and you may forfeit all or some) Staking Rewards. BNB has no liability or responsibility for and expressly disclaims any loss, liability or damage that users may incur directly or indirectly in connection with the Soft Staking Services, including without limitation loss, liability or damage arising directly or indirectly from interruptions, errors or defects in the Soft Staking Services, third party disruptions of or unauthorized access to the Soft Staking Services and any suspension or discontinuance of the Soft Staking Services.</p>
                                <p class="head-thick pb-2">BNB does not guarantee that you will receive Staking Rewards at the Staking Rate shown at the time you Subscribe. The Staking Rate is designed to change from time to time and may fluctuate up or down from the rate applicable at the time of Subscription. Any representation concerning possible returns at the time you Subscribe is an estimate only and not guaranteed; and based on the Staking Rate at the relevant time, which may change. Staking Rewards for Soft Staking are calculated based on factors determined at BNB’s sole discretion, based on the On-Chain Rewards and the commission fee charged by BNB, each of which may change from time to time. All On-Chain Rewards will be retained by BNB and participants in Soft Staking Staking will only receive the Staking Rewards, which may be more or less than the amount of On-Chain Rewards.</p>
                                <p class="head-thick pb-2">BNB may run promotional campaigns from time to time that are sponsored by partner projects including short-term Soft Staking product offerings with higher APRs to benefit users. These higher rates may be temporary and you should consider whether the relevant offer still meets your needs once the interest rate reverts to its normally anticipated levels when the promotion period expires.</p>
